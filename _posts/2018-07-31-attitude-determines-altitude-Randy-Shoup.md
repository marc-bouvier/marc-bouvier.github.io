## Growth mindset

Dr Carol Dweck of Stanford [Mindset - the new psychology of success](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322).
> Our belief about wether we can improve that is gonna help us actually improve.

| Fixed mindset                                     | Growth mindset                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Talent is static                                  | Talent can be developed                        |
| Leadds to a desire to look smart and therefore... | Leads to learn and therefore a tendency to ... |
| Avoid challenges                                  | Embrace challenges                             | 
| Give up easily due to obstacles                   | Persist despite obstacles                      |
| See effort as fruitless                           | See effort as path to mastery                  |
| Ignore useful feedback                            | Learn from criticism                           |
| Be threatened by others' success                  |  Be inspired by others' success                |

We get there by doing. 
Effort means that we actually care about something.

## The expert mind

[Philip E. Ross, Scientific American, August 2006](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-expert-mind/)

> Experts are made, not born.

> Effortful study is the key to achieving success in chess, classical music, soccer and many other fields.

## The 10,000 Hour Rule

[Outliers - The Story of Success - Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book))

> Ten thousand hours is the magic number of greatness

Deliberate practice with constant challenge

> Practice isn't the thnig you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good.

## The progess principle

[The progress principle - Dr. Teresa Amabile - Harvard Business School ]()

> "Inner work life" drives performance - constant stream of emotions, perception, and motivations

The way you approach as you are going along.

> Making progress on meaningful work most strongly improves motivation and performance

> Steady progress and small wins lead to big gains

## Focus and attention

[Focus and attention - Daniel Goleman 2013](https://www.amazon.com/Focus-Hidden-Excellence-Daniel-Goleman/dp/0062114964)

> Ability to focus ("cognitive control") is the best predictor of success and high achievement

Creativity from "open awareness"
* Daydreaming (great ideas in the shower, runnnig, walking, quiet, driving ...)
* Finding unexpected connections

Execution from focus
* Goal focus
* Resistance to distraction

> Attention is a "Mental Muscle"

> From the perspective of congnitive science, all meditation methods are methods to train attention.
> Daniel Goleman

-> yoga, meditation ...

> It's not that I'm so smart; it's just that I stay with problems longer.
> Albert Einstein
